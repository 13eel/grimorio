Some characters passively receive information, some need to take action to learn who is who, while some simply want to bait the Demon into attacking them. Both good and evil can gain the upper hand by making well-timed sacrifices.\nTrouble Brewing is a relatively straightforward Demon hunt, but evil has a number of dastardly misinformation tricks up their sleeves, so the good players had better question what they think they know if they hope to survive.",

If the good team cannot determine which Minions and Demons are in play, however, their doom is all but certain.",
